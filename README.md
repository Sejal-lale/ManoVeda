# 🌸 Manoveda

**Manoveda** is a student-first mental wellness app designed for moments of mental freeze, overwhelm, and emotional fatigue.  
It is **not a productivity app** — it is a *gentle intervention system* that helps users take the smallest possible step forward.

## 🧠 Why Manoveda?

Students often don’t need motivation — they need **decision relief**.

Manoveda focuses on:
- Reducing cognitive overload  
- Breaking avoidance loops  
- Offering emotional safety without pressure  

No streaks.  
No goals.  
No guilt.
